# LendingClub-Loan-Repayment-Prediction
Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest Model to Predict Loan Repayment for Lending Club Borrowers. An analysis-driven project to help predict borrower repayment status, leveraging decision tree-based models to support investor decision-making.

# Lending Club Loan Repayment Prediction

This project explores loan repayment prediction for Lending Club borrowers, using decision tree and random forest models. Through feature engineering and model training, we aim to predict whether a borrower will repay their loan in full, offering insights for investors seeking lower-risk profiles.

## Project Overview
Lending Club connects borrowers with investors, allowing individuals to invest in loans based on borrowers' profiles. In this project, we analyze data from 2007-2010 to build a model that classifies whether a loan will be repaid fully.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- **Credit Policy**: Lending Club's underwriting criteria compliance
- **Purpose**: Loan purpose, such as credit card or debt consolidation
- **Interest Rate**: Proportional interest rate
- **Monthly Installment**: Payment amount per month
- **Income, Credit Score**: Financial health indicators

Data source: Lending Club public data from 2007-2010

## Objectives
1. **Data Analysis**: Explore borrower characteristics
2. **Feature Engineering**: Refine variables for model accuracy
3. **Modeling**: Apply decision tree and random forest classifiers

## Skills Utilized
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling NA values, categorical encoding
